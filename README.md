#### Project reflections:

We first started out by finding inspiration images of UI and implemented them into our Figma wireframe to get an idea of how we wanted to display our information in a fun and user friendly format. *[ Would you be cool finishing up the description of how this project was made? ]*

#### Group member reflections:

##### Cyanne Jones: 
I'm honestly really proud of this project. My learning goals were to get comfortable Cypress testing and using React Router to create multiple URLs to help a user navigate an application and we absolutely achieved that. For the most part, this project was tackled asynchronously with standup meetings held (almost) daily to discuss goals for the day. I feel like using this working style helped me feel much more independent, and made the standup meetings feel more important than just paired-programming after them. I'm so happy to have had the experience writing really in-depth PR reviews as well. Overall, this was a really enjoyable project, and I'm so happy Masaki was the coolest project partner.
