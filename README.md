# Rancid Tomatillos
##### A Turing Mod 3 Paired project from [Masaki Kleinkopf](https://github.com/masaki-kleinkopf) and [Cyanne Jones](https://github.com/Cyanne-Jones)

*Would you like information for all the best movies' information at your fingertips? Search no farther! Rancid Tomatillos is for you!*

### How to access the application:
#### Go to this [link](https://shrouded-brushlands-38554.herokuapp.com/) where the application is deployed on Heroku

#### Or if you prefer to access the code as well as the application follow these *installallation instructions*

- Clone down this repository into your local machine
- `cd` into the root directory of the repo
- Run `npm i` in your console to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` in the console to start the sever and access the application from your browser

#### Usage

Now that you've got access to Rancid Tomatillos, feel free to browse through the collection of films and click on the ones you're interested in to see their details. You can see the day it was released, the revenue, genre and much more! You can share specific URLs with your friends to share the details of you chosen movie, and just in case the URL is invalid, there's a fun little error page to take you back to the home page so you can keep browsing without even missing a beat! 

#### See it in action!!

#### Project reflections and goals:

We decided together what our shared and individual learning goals were for our project. This was our first large project in React, and we wanted to focus on having a clear outline for our React component architecture. We spent a lot of time planning this out, and largely stuck to it once we started writing our code. We also planned out our design of the app, by finding inspiration images of UI and implemented them into our Figma wireframe to get an idea of how we wanted to display our information in a fun and user friendly format. For our workflow, we wanted to focus on a divide and conquer method for much of the project with daily standups, though we did pair programming sessions for subjects we were unfamiliar with, such as React Router. Our last goal was to write a robust test suite using Cypress to get really familiar with this new technology. We tried to test for every user flow and especially made sure to find all sad paths to test.

#### Group member reflections:

##### Cyanne Jones: 
I'm honestly really proud of this project. My learning goals were to get comfortable Cypress testing and using React Router to create multiple URLs to help a user navigate an application and we absolutely achieved that. For the most part, this project was tackled asynchronously with standup meetings held (almost) daily to discuss goals for the day. I feel like using this working style helped me feel much more independent, and made the standup meetings feel more important than just paired-programming after them. I'm so happy to have had the experience writing really in-depth PR reviews as well. Overall, this was a really enjoyable project, and I'm so happy Masaki was the coolest project partner.

##### Masaki Kleinkopf:
I learned a ton from this project. We learned a lot of new tech, including React, React Router and Cypress and I felt that we really dove into those technologies, as well as honing existing skills such as CSS. Overall, our teamwork went really well. This is the first project at Turing where we had daily standups and a focus on a divide and conquer method, and I really thought it made my async communication better. This made me realize the importance of having clear commit messages and git workflow. I think I could be better at code reviews, and I learned a lot from Cyanne with how organized and insightful her feedback was. Overall, Cyanne was a great partner, and aside from her obvious skill in programming, she was very good at planning and project organization before diving into the code and that's something I will hope to be better at in future projects.
